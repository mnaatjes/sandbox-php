# Versioning Rules

Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is the key to managing this:

**MAJOR** (e.g., v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0): 
- You increment this number when you make incompatible API changes, also known as backward compatibility (BC) breaks. 
- This is the signal to your users that upgrading will require them to change their code.

**MINOR** (e.g., v2.0.0 -> v2.1.0): 
- You increment this for new, backward-compatible features.

**PATCH** (e.g., v2.1.1 -> v2.1.2): 
- You increment this for backward-compatible bug fixes
